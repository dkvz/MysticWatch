Libraries to use (not using Maven for this):
  * Google's JSON-Simple
  * Apache httpClient

I created a "libraries" directory to hold those. Netbeans should be able to auto-find the libraries with the relative path. Another IDE may not, re-add the libraries accordingly.

===== JSON-Simple =====
Namespace is import org.json.simple.*;


===== Ideas - Issues =====
  * The system could use an authentication token to check how much money you have in bank and which item you can afford (highlight those?).
  * In craft components, I should be able to put in fixed price stuff (stuff that you can't get on the TP).
  * Some of the items also require a recipe...
  * Make a "name cache", loading on demand when needed to fetch item names. Advanced stuff: provide a way to purge name cache.
  * I think quantity is absent from the transaction log display. There are listings but those are independant from the total quantity of items.
  * I forgot about two types of TPEvents about listings that are gone. I don't know if that has consequences for the UI too.
  * I don't think I've put the TPEvent logging started (and ended) anywhere, that should be a thing.

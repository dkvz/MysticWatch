Libraries to use (not using Maven for this):
  * Google's JSON-Simple
  * Apache httpClient

I created a "libraries" directory to hold those. Netbeans should be able to auto-find the libraries with the relative path. Another IDE may not, re-add the libraries accordingly.

===== JSON-Simple =====
Namespace is import org.json.simple.*;


===== Ideas - Issues =====
  * The system could use an authentication token to check how much money you have in bank and which item you can afford (highlight those?).
  * Add the column for the supply/demand ratio.
  * In craft components, I should be able to put in fixed price stuff (stuff that you can't get on the TP).
  * Some of the items also require a recipe...
  * File->Exit does not ask for confirmation.

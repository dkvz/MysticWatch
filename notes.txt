Libraries to use (not using Maven for this):
  * Google's JSON-Simple
  * Apache httpClient

I created a "libraries" directory to hold those. Netbeans should be able to auto-find the libraries with the relative path. Another IDE may not, re-add the libraries accordingly.

===== JSON-Simple =====
Namespace is import org.json.simple.*;


===== Ideas - Issues =====
  * The system could use an authentication token to check how much money you have in bank and which item you can afford (highlight those?).
  * Some of the items also require a recipe...
  * Make a "name cache", loading on demand when needed to fetch item names. Advanced stuff: provide a way to purge name cache.
  * I don't think I've put the TPEvent logging started (and ended) anywhere, that should be a thing.
  * Transaction logging always starts with a single event of "Highest buy order changed", and it's bogus.
  * Attemting to delete a transaction log often doesn't work because of the state file. Maybe the handle is left open somewhere?

Libraries to use (not using Maven for this):
  * Google's JSON-Simple
  * Apache httpClient

I created a "libraries" directory to hold those. Netbeans should be able to auto-find the libraries with the relative path. Another IDE may not, re-add the libraries accordingly.

===== JSON-Simple =====
Namespace is import org.json.simple.*;
